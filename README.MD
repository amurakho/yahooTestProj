## NOTE: You need python 3.8+

### Data entry
As I understand, it has no matter how should I take the data.
The task is - take the data.

So I make it as I see it. 

But I also understand - if have to follow the plan that is indicated in the assignment, I have to use RoboBrowser / MechanicalSoup or Selenium

Also, as I understand the company list is the same as the company in the URL. So I didn't need to take it from search.
But if the business side needs it, I can take it from search. 

Like I know. it is python library for the yahoo finance side (yfinance).
Unfortunately, Yahoo API was closed, so the library is old
Anyway, I reviewed the code and choose this library because I think it is good for this simple task.

### News Parsing:

Like I see, yahoo has api to get the news. But I need some time to analyze URL, because it's not so simple.
I think the best solution is to parse this API URL and pass with changed params but I have no time to analyze it.
So I parse the script tag in HTML template.
